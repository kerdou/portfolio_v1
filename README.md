Here is a list of things you should know before getting any further.

### :dart: What my portfolio is <a name = "is"></a>

- An occasion to push my frontend knowledge much further
- An occasion to do things by myself by deliberately not relying on any library

- A way to express my personality, loving it or hating it is up to you
- Probably my last project before jumping into frameworks
